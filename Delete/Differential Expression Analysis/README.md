# Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus Differential Expression Analysis
Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus Differential Expression Analysis from RNA seq Data on R

10 samples of RNA seq sata where used to perform this analysis

Data was divided into controls and treatments

Controls correspond to samples that were not infected with bacteria an only with pasteurized artifitial sea water

Treatments correspond to samples that were infected with a coctail of a Gram positive (Microccocus luteus) and a Gram negative (Vibrio fischeri) bacteria

Analysis was performed in R studio using the packages:

-apeglm

-ape

-Biostrings

-DESeq2

-circlize

-clusterProfiler

-ComplexHeatmap

-CorLevelPlot

-corrplot

-dplyr
