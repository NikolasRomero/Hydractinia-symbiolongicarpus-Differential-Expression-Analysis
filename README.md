Trying to aim the immune response to both Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria RNA-seq data from an immune challenge was generated 

Here we explain step by step the complete analysis from the counts generation to a phyllogenetic analysis inclufind coexpression network generations and cross data with Hydractinia cell atlas
